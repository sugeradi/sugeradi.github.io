title: "An improved topographic correction model based on Minnaert"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016-3-GISRS
excerpt: 'In this article, we used visual inspection, statistical analysis, and correlation analysis to evaluate the algorithms and performance of the proposed Minnaert-E approach. The results indicate that corrections based on non-Lambertian methods have better performance than those based on the Lambertian assumption. The correction performances can be ranked as the Minnaert-E, followed by the Minnaert and the SCS+C corrections, and, finally, the C-HuangWei correction, which performed the worst. We found that the Minnaert-E approach can effectively weaken the influence of terrain relief on pixels and restore the true reflectance of the pixels in the relief area. Further analysis indicates that the Minnaert-E has a better effect on image processing where the slope gradient is restricted to less than 10° or between 30° and 43°.'
