title: "InSAR time-series investigation of long-term ground displacement at Beijing Capital International Airport, China"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016-11-Tectonophysics
excerpt: 'Previous studies has indicated that long-term intense groundwater extraction is the main reason leading to land subsidence in this area. Other triggering factors, such as active faults, the quaternary compressible layers and urbanization, also have different degrees of contribution or impact on land subsidence in Beijing Plain. Furthermore, some interesting behaviors from groundwater (such as inter- and semi-annual variations) and subsidence, the relationship between them are also found in this study.'
